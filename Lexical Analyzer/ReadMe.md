# Lexical Analyzer

## About
This project was an excersice for the "Compiler Design" class in university.
The app gets an input written code from the user, & then analyzes every character to find a valid code based on it's grammar. It can recognize IDs, operators, int numbers, float numbers & blank spaces. The code will also recognize errors, any unvalid text that does not fit in any of the grammars declared, will be considered as an error.
The output of this code will be the colored (Sintax Highlighting) code (just like modern IDEs) & a report that contains the count of every recognized grammar & the errors found.
